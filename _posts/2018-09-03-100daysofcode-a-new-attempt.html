<p>
	A little over a month ago I started the #100DaysOfCode challenge with the intention of learning to code, although I already know the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I wanted to make a review of those subjects and learn them in deep.
</p>

<p>
	Since when I started learning Web Development I did it in a rush because I needed to build something fast, I really think I need to start all over again, I feel like there are so many bad practices I code with, to start I completely misuse HTML elements, I copy-paste JavaScript code and CSS without really understanding what it does (misusing StackOverflow) and the JavaScript I do write is far from maintainable, although with time I've been using abstraction more and more.
</p>


<p>
	Anyway, I've been coding every day as the challenge propose but as my main purpose was to learn I felt like I wasn't taking any advantage of the challenge so I stopped posting about it on Twitter, that until two days ago when I started my learning path again.
</p>

<h2>A solo Bootcamp.</h2>

<p>
	In this second attempt of the challenge, I'll focus solely on learning, most Bootcamps promise you'll be able to land a job after 8 to 12 weeks of intensive learning and I'll try to do just that but on my own.
</p>
<p>
	I'm gonna give it 12 weeks since I'm doing it on my own and I wont be able to dedicate 9 to 5 all days to this but if i feel ready I will start applying some junior roles after week 8, or at least some freelance gigs on UpWork or something like that.
</p>

<h2 id="curriculum">Curriculum and progress</h2>

<p>
	I'll be following the FreeCodeCamp curriculum and I'll complement it with video tutorials, since I'm more of a video person, I'll try to mimic some of the popular Bootcamps curriculums out there so besides FreeCodeCamp, these are the courses I'll be taking at first, I don't plan to spend the full 12 weeks on these but I also don't want to stablish a hard deadline to complete them, once I've done them all, I'll add some more subjects untill I reach week 12.
