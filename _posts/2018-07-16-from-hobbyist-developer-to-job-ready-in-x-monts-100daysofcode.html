	Hey!! My name is Arturo, I'm a hobbyist developer from Venezuela and this year I decided to go full time into becoming a <strong>job ready</strong> professional developer. I'll be documenting my journey through this blog.
</p>

<h2>A little background check.</h2>

<p>
	I've been flirting with web development for several years now. I started back when Blogger was a thing and by trying to modify the blog looks and functionality I ended up reading "Head First HTML and CSS" from O REILLY, that was a time when there weren't as many video resources as there're now and that book really helped me getting my feets wet and to grasp the very basic concepts and methodologies of web design.
</p>
<p>
	After realizing it was really complicated to tweak a Blogger blog, and that it was already an outdated tool, I dived into WordPress only to encounter face by face with PHP and a lot of server-side programming, tweaking, and hacking. I started to hate it rapidly (looking back in time I know now that the only reason to hate it was because I didn't devote enough time learning the very basics, in fact, I didn't learn anything, I just blindly followed how-to guides trying to get out the way and and publish something fast).
</p>
<p>
	I gave up on WordPress and gave CouchCms a try, it felt most natural and was easier to adopt, I finally understood a little bit of PHP and met JavaScript, the more I went into JavaScript the more I liked it and I started thinking that there had to be a way to ditch PHP and work entirely on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I followed some JS tutorials and found about static websites (Jekyll to be more specific) I rapidly ditched anything PHP and focused on static sites development.
</p>
<p>
	By the time of writing I have very basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS, I've completed two paid side projects for two different clients, but all of this I've done intermittently while having a full-time job so I've spent months in a row without touching a single line of code, then coding for a few days to leave it again for months.
</p>

<h2>Committing 100% into learning and practicing.</h2>

<p>
	So in mid-Jun, I decided to relearn everything from the start in order to gain a strong knowledge of the fundamentals and make my way out. I already quit my full-time job so I'm committing 100% of my time to properly learn and to build things along the way.
</p>
<p>
	I'm taking the #100DaysOfCode challenge so I'll do my best to code daily using what I've learned on that day. My plan is to spend the day going through tutorials and try to apply what I learn to real-world problems. For every topic I learn, I'll go to StackOverflow to see what people are having trouble with and try to solve that on my own, or at least to really understand the solutions given by others. This is a totally different usage than what I've been giving to StackOverflow which I've been using like a simple copy-paste tool.
</p>

<h2>Landing a developer job in X months.</h2>

<p>
	While my main focus is to gain a really deep knowledge of coding and the different technologies used for that mean, I'll try to do it as fast as I can in order to land a job as fast as possible, firstly because I need it, and secondly because I want to be physically involved in a development environment, I think an entry-level position will help me learn faster and expand my horizons.
</p>
<p>
	I've read that some people land their first job in a year, some even in as little as 8 months, some of them even before finishing FreeCodeCamp curriculum. I've been scanning job portals and have seen very appealing offers for junior roles with requirements I don't think are very hard to accomplish. 
</p>
<p>
	So given I already have some basic coding knowledge and that I will commit 100% of my time I think I will be ready to start applying for jobs by January 2019, although besides coding I also need to improve my English as it's not my native language.
</p>
<p>
	I think, from my starting point, landing an entry-level job in six months is doable but who knows, only time will say, that's why the "<b>X</b>" on the post title.
</p>
	 
<h2>The initial path to follow.</h2>

<p>
	To start I'll be taking the FreeCodeCamp HTML and CSS curriculum, I'll combine it with reading MDN guides and documentation in order to deepen the knowledge. After that, I'll start the JavaSript paths combined with Anthony Alicea and Wesbos video tutorials, once I'm confident with vanilla JS I'll go on to learn the most used frameworks like REACT, ANGULAR, and VUE.
</p>
<p>
	Then who knows, I'm pretty sure this intended path will grow every day, looking ahead it seems a very long road but I need to start somewhere and NOW is the best time to do it, I'm also confident that I will enjoy the ride.
</p>
<p>
	Besides the defined path I'll also spend some time of my day improving my English and learning to use some tool or really anything that I find useful, something that may be used in job environments, for example, yesterday I learned to use Trello to organize my Ideas and daily activities, today I plan to give a look at Slack.

	So this is all for now, you can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/ar2royv" title="Arturo's twitter profile">twitter</a> and stay updated about my progress of which I'll tweet every day as it's required by the challenge. I'll also be posting a detailed update every week on this blog.
