<p>
	Yesterday I completed my first week of the #100DaysOfCode challenge and I've been focusing on relearning the very basics of web development, starting from HTML all the way through CSS and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
	Contrary to what I thought at first, it took me what I think is a lot of time to review the basics. HTML is a topic in which I had (or maybe still have) a lot of weaknesses, maybe because the way I learned it in the first place, years ago I learned it in a rush without digging any deeper than the basics, since then I've been blindly relying on frameworks (Bootstrap), limiting myself to copy-paste code in an effort to make my layouts work.
</p>
<p>
	So I've spent the entire first week of the #100DaysOfCode challenge focused on HTML, trying to balance my inherent desire to rush things up, and also my desire to dig as deep as I can trying to review every bit of information there is on the subject of my learning.
</p>
<h3>It's ok to not know everything. In fact it's impossible to.</h3>
<p>
	I've found that, at least for now, there are a lot of topics on which I'll have a lack of knowledge/understanding, I just have to create the habit of review the documentation anytime I hit a wall or I'm in doubt. For example, after trying to validate this website on the W3C validator I got some errors I had to investigate:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		I was getting some closing <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags without their corresponding opening tag, after investigating in the MDN documentation I found that browsers will close <code>p</code> elements if they find some elements like lists among others. I used to think of <code>p</code> elements like block level elements that I could throw anything into.
	</li>
	<li>
		I placed an <code>address</code> element with my info and inside it, I enclosed my name inside a h1 heading, well, turns out the <code>address</code> element doesn't accept headings nor sectioning content.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	My point here is that it's impossible to try to know every specification for every element, attribute etc. What I think is important is one's ability to investigate and analyze when things broke or when in doubt, and make this a habit.
</p>
<p>
	I also created this blog last week, and I've been updating its code as I went through my learning path. I've also been writing annotations of the topics I either don't understand at first or which I think I need to read again and again until they stick to my memory.
</p>
<h3>This is the resume of my first week on the challenge:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>
		Created this website from scratch (no framework) and have been updating its code to make it more compliant and semantic. I made it pass the W3C validation without errors or warning.
	</li>
	<li>
		Completed FCC Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5 and MDN HTML learning path.
	</li>
	<li>
		Learned how to use <span class="bold">codepen</span> to publish and share code snippets.
	</li>
	<li>
		Learned how to use (at least the very basics) <span class="bold">codeanywhere</span> to run complete projects on the cloud.
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>Next week objectives (minimum):</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Go through a series of CSS tutorials.</li>
	<li>Complete at least FCC Basic CSS.</li>
	<li>Review MDN CSS section.</li>
	<li>Refresh Knowledge by going through TheOdinProject HTML and CSS paths.</li>
</ol>
