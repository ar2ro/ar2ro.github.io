		<h1>My personal annotations for every learning path I follow</h1>
		<p>
			This page includes my annotations for every learning path I follow, they're very personal as they only include concepts, examples, and references I feel like I need to review over time, and they're written in a manner that it's easy for me to understand. Feel free to take a look.
